Sort by Date Added and Album
============================

Normally when you sort your iTunes library by date added, tracks do not appear in the order they appear on the album.

This script allows you to sort by date added, grouped by album, and in album order.

To use:

1. Run the `install` script or manually copy `Sort by Date Added and Album.applescript` to `~/Library/iTunes/Scripts`.

2. Then, select some tracks in your library and select `Sort by Date Added and Album` from the scripts menu in iTunes.

3. Make the "Show" column visible and sort in descending order.

Voila! Your tracks are now sorted by date added, grouped by album and disc, and in the order they appear on the album.


## NOTE: this copies/overwrites (a nicely sortable string) to `Show` field (which you can sort by later) -- each time you use it
## NOTE: exclude tracks/items still in iCloud (and not local to your machine), or download them first, or else script fails when gets to them
